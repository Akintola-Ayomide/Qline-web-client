# Qline - Smart Queue Management (Web Frontend)

**Qline** is a modern, premium web application designed to streamline operations and enhance customer experiences through intelligent queue management. This repository contains the **web frontend**, built with the latest web technologies to deliver a sophisticated, responsive, and performance-driven user interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
- **Secure Cookie-Based Auth**: Fully implemented HTTP-only cookie authentication for maximum security (XSS protection).
- **Google OAuth Integration**: Native-feel "Continue with Google" flow with a dedicated loading state and callback handling (`/auth/callback`).
- **Robust State Management**: Global `AuthProvider` context managing user sessions, loading states, and automatic profile fetching.
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Custom `ApiError` class handling structured backend errors, providing clear feedback to users (e.g., validation issues, invalid credentials).

### 🎨 Design & Experience
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Glassmorphism effects (`backdrop-blur`, `bg-white/60`), vibrant gradients, and sophisticated typography (Geist Sans/Mono + Italic Accents).
- **Interactive Animations**: Smooth transitions powered by `framer-motion` for switching between Login and Signup modes (`AnimatePresence`).
- **Responsive Layout**: A split-screen design featuring a dynamic branding hero section (desktop) and a clean, focused form area (mobile/desktop).
- **Custom Branding**: Unique "Qline" logo design with a distinct typographic treatment and decorative background elements.

### 🏗 Architecture
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Codebase organized by features (e.g., `features/auth`) containing dedicated components, services, hooks, and types.
- **Shared UI Library**: Reusable implementation of atomic components (Buttons, Inputs, Checkboxes) located in `shared/ui`.
- **Next.js 16 App Router**: Leveraging Server Components and Client Components appropriately for performance and SEO.
- **TypeScript**: Strict type safety across DTOs, API responses, and Component props.

## 🔗 Backend Connect
This frontend is designed to consume a standard REST API with secure cookie support.
- **Base URL**: Configurable via `.env`
- **Auth Flow**: Uses `credentials: 'include'` for all requests to ensure HttpOnly cookies are passed.
- **Auth Endpoints**:
    - `POST /auth/login` (Returns 200 + Set-Cookie)
    - `POST /auth/register` (Returns 200 + Set-Cookie)
    - `POST /auth/logout` (Clears Cookies)
    - `GET /auth/profile`
    - `GET /auth/google` (Redirects to Provider)
